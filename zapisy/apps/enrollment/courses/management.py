"""These functions help organise enrolment, in particular for freshmen and ISIM.

Group splitting is going to be used in two ways: One is creating separate groups
for ISIM and CS students. This aims to solve the problem of ISIM students being
handicapped in the enrolment by having fewer ECTS credits and later opening
times.

The second is creating three bags of freshmen students ('tura1', 'tura2', and
'tura3'), splitting the most desired course groups into 3, and attaching
different opening times to these groups. It lets off-load the system a bit in
the most heated moment.

Usage in new semester scenario:
  1. Import schedule from the scheduler.
  2. Create groups for ISIM using split_out_isim function.
  3. Select freshmen groups for splitting and split them using split_in_three.
  4. Set semester enrolment opening time on the admin page.
  5. Click «Refresh opening times» on the admin page.
  6. Run adjust_split_in_three_opening_times.
  7. If you want to change general enrollment time or someone's personal bonus,
     remember to do 5. and 6.
  8. At some point you may want to merge groups using merge_groups function. To
     merge three freshmen virtual groups set merge_queues argument to False. To
     merge regular group with ISIM virtual group set it to True.
