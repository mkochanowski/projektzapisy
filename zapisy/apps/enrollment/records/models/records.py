"""Module records is the heart of enrollment logic.

Record Lifetime:

  The record's status transitions in one direction: QUEUED -> ENROLLED ->
  REMOVED. The ENROLLED phase may be skipped if the student removes his record
  while he is in the queue, or if the enrollment is unsuccessful. The REMOVED
  phase may not occur if the student ends up being enrolled into the group.

  enqueue_student(student, group): The life of a record begins with this
    function, which puts the student into the queue of the group. It may create
    multiple records for the student, if the provided group is an exercise/lab
    group and the student should also be put into the corresponding lecture
    group. The record will not be created if the function `can_enqueue` does not
    pass.

    Immediately after records are created, an asynchronous task is placed (in
    the task queue), to pull as many records in these groups as possible from
    their respective queues. The tasks are placed using a signal
    (GROUP_CHANGE_SIGNAL) defined in `apps/enrollment/records/signals.py`. They
    are picked up by the function `pull_from_queue_signal_receiver` in
    `apps/enrollment/records/tasks.py`.

  fill_group(group_id): The asynchronous task runs this function. It is a loop
    calling `pull_record_into_group` as long as it returns True, which means
    that there still place in the group and students in the queue.

  pull_record_into_group(group_id): Picks the first student in the group's queue
    and tries to enroll him in the group using `enroll_or_remove`.

  enroll_or_remove(record): Takes the record and tries to change its status from
    QUEUED to ENROLLED. This operation will be unsuccessful if the function
    `can_enroll` does not pass, in which case the record's status will be
    changed to REMOVED. This function additionally removes the student from all
    the parallel groups upon enrolling him into this one, and removes him from
    all the queues of lower priority.

  remove_from_group(student, group): Removes student from the group or its
    queue, thus changing the record's status to REMOVED. If the group is a
    lecture group, the student is also removed from the corresponding
    exercise/lab groups. All the groups that are vacated by the student must be
    filled by an asynchronous process, so the GROUP_CHANGE_SIGNAL is sent.
