// It will put the prototype component in the DOM element with id #timetable.
// Two sets of data is read â€” the description of all the courses, and the
// description of groups the student is enqueued/enrolled into. Two <script
// type="application/json"></script> elements are used for this, one with id
// #courses-list, the other with id #timetable-data. For details look into
// `store/{groups.ts, courses.ts}`.
